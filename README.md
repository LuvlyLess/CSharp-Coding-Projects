CSharp .NET Framework Coding Projects  AOLCC
I' have learned to create a variety of programs using the C# programming language. 
as well as ASP.NET to create web applications and learn how to use the Model-View-Controller framework (MVC) to produce stable and robust web applications.

In this repository of submissions for my AOLCC. I have learned and show my ability to:

#1 Work with Arrays
Create a console app that does/contains the following:
Create a one-dimensional Array of strings. Ask the user to select an index of the Array and then display the string at that index on the screen.
Create a one-dimensional Array of integers. Ask the user to select an index of the Array and then display the integer at that index on the screen.
Add in a message that displays when the user selects an index that doesn’t exist.
Create a list of strings. Ask the user to select an index of the list and then display the content at that index on the screen.


#2 Iterating
Create a list of strings that has at least two identical strings in the list. 
Create a foreach loop that evaluates each item in the list, and displays a message showing the string and whether or not it has already appeared in the list. For example, if you had a list of letters: {“A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “C”}, you could have the following print to the screen.

#3 Exception Handling, Classes and Objects
create a console app that includes the following:
Create a list of integers. Ask the user for a number to divide each number in the list by. Write a loop that takes each integer in the list, divides it by the number the user entered, and displays the result to the screen.
Run the code, entering in non-zero numbers as the user. Look at the displayed results.
Run the code again, entering in zero as the number to divide by. Note any error messages you get.
Run the code once again, entering in a string as the number to divide by. Note any error messages you get.
Now put the loop in a try/catch block. Below and outside of the try/catch block, make the program print a message to the display to let you know the program has emerged from the try/catch block and continued on with program execution. In the catch block, display the error message to the screen. Then try various combinations of user input: valid numbers, zero and a string. Ensure the proper error messages display on the screen, and that the code after the try/catch block gets executed.


#4 Methods
Calling Methods Assignment, Main Method Assignment, Method Assignment, Method Class Assignment,Class Method Assignment


#5 Class Concepts
Methods and Objects Assignment, Abstract Class Assignment, Polymorphism Assignment

 create a console app that includes the following:
Create a class called Person and give it two properties, each of data type string. One called FirstName, the other LastName.
Give this class a void method called SayName() that takes no parameters and simply writes the person's full name to the console in the format of: “Name: [full name]”.
Create another class called Employee and have it inherit from the Person class. Give the Employee class a property called Id and have it be of data type int.
Inside of the Main method, instantiate and initialize an Employee object with a first name of “Sample” and a last name of “Student”.
Call the superclass method SayName() on the Employee object.

#6 Debugging and Value Types
Operators Assignment, Parsing Enums, Lambda Expression
create a console app that includes the following:
Create an Employee class with the following properties:
a. Id
b. First Name
c. Last Name
In the Main() method, create a list of at least 10 employees. At least two employees should have the first name “Joe”.
Using a foreach loop, create a new list of all employees with the first name “Joe”. In your comparison statement, remember to reference the property of the object you are checking.
Perform the same action again, but this time with a lambda expression.
Using a lambda expression, make a list of all employees with an Id number greater than 5.


#7 Libraries
Constructor Assignment
#8 Database and MVC
create a console app that includes the following:
Create a const variable.
Create a variable using the keyword “var.”
Chain two constructors together.
